# What is this
This project simply converts an excel spreadsheet of data (template.xlsx and example data included) into a 3 dimensional render of your 7-die set
Example data is the actual values i have rolled and not randomly generated via an algorithm, they are actually my dice and as i get new ones there will be more example data

# How to use
Roll each die 100 times (or make up random numbers) and put them in the relative column of the spreadsheet.
Each die requires a minimum of 100 values for the renderer to work properly.
If you only want to do 1 die, or dont feel like rolling 100 numbers you can just use 0 instead.
Run the main.py file (see "Requirements to use"), and then select the chosen data-set and die once the window opens

# Requirements to use
- [vpython](https://vpython.org) 
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io) 
- (if there are alternative 3d gfx or spreadsheets libraries that are more efficient/easier to use/whatever lmk via issues and ill investigate it)
